# Autonomous Mobile Manipulator in Multi-Floor Environment

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository simulates a **mobile manipulator robot system** operating across **two floors**, integrating:

* **AMR Base** for autonomous navigation (Gazebo + Nav2)
* **Linear Guide + RealMan 7DoF Robotic Arm** for pick-and-place
* **Pipeline FSM** for task orchestration (perception → planning → execution)
* **Dynamic Obstacles** (human agents) for realistic testing
* **Lift/Elevator simulation** for multi-floor transport

The robot autonomously picks packages from racks on the ground floor, navigates to a lift, travels to the second floor, and drops packages on a designated table using vision-guided manipulation.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Launch Gazebo with Navigation 2

```bash
ros2 launch alphabot_navigation gazebo.launch.py
```

This starts Gazebo with the Navigation 2 stack for autonomous navigation.

### 2. Launch MoveIt 2 for Arm Control

```bash
ros2 launch mobile_manipulator_bringup moveit_bringup.launch.py
```

This initializes MoveIt 2 for motion planning and control of the robotic arm.

### 3. Run the Manipulation Pipeline

```bash
ros2 launch pipeline_manipulator pipeline_fsm.launch.py
```

This launches the pipeline FSM to coordinate perception, planning, and task execution.

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

After sourcing your workspace:

* **Gazebo with Navigation 2**:

```bash
ros2 launch alphabot_navigation gazebo.launch.py
```

* **MoveIt 2 for Arm Control**:

```bash
ros2 launch mobile_manipulator_bringup moveit_bringup.launch.py
```

* **Manipulation Pipeline FSM**:

```bash
ros2 launch pipeline_manipulator pipeline_fsm.launch.py
```

---

## 🧠 Troubleshooting Tips

* **Gazebo Launch Issues**: Ensure all required models/plugins are installed and sourced.
* **MoveIt 2 Configuration**: Verify URDF/SRDF paths are correct.
* **Pipeline FSM Errors**: Check logs for missing dependencies or misconfigured launch files.

If you want, I can also **generate a ready-to-use PDF version of this README** that you can attach along with your Task 2 report for your manager.

Do you want me to do that next?
